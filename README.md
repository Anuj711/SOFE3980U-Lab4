In modern softwares, Machine Learning (ML) models are playing a crucial roles. Testing modern softwares should include testing the ML models. The designing of the ML model is out the Lab scope. Only ML testing will be covered. Different problems will be considered .For each problem type, crossponding metrcis is utilized.

## 1. Single-variable Continuous Regression Problem

This goal is to estimate the value of a continuous variable, $$y$$ ,using the values of input variables, $$\mathbf{x}=\{x_0,...,x_n}$$
